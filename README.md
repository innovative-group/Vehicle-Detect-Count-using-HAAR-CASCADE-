# [Vehicle-Detect-Count] using HAAR-CASCADE-
Vechile detection & counting Vehicle Detection & Counting using [HAAR CASCADE]


It is a simple machine learning-based vehicle detection and counting program which simply detect and will count the number of vehicle(i.e Car & bus) which are present in our image.

In this project, we will be using 
    i> Google CoLab,
    ii> OpenCV,
    iii> HAAR CASCADE algorithm
