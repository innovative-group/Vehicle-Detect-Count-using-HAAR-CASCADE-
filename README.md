# Project Title
[Vehicle-Detect-Count] using HAAR CASCADE

It is a simple machine learning-based vehicle detection and counting program which simply detect and will count the number of vehicle(i.e Car & bus) which are present in our image.

In this project, we will be using 
    i> Google CoLab,
    ii> OpenCV,
    iii> HAAR CASCADE algorithm

## Documentation
Object Detection & Counting:
----------------------------
It is a simple machine learning-based vehicle detection and counting program which simply detect and will count the number of vehicle(i.e Car & bus) which are present in our image.

In this project, we will be using i> Google CoLab, ii> OpenCV, iii> HAAR CASCADE algorithm


Vehicle Detection & Counting:
-----------------------------
In this project, we will be using 
    i> Google CoLab,
    ii> OpenCV,
    iii> HAAR CASCADE algorithm
    
And we also need to download two different files 
    i>  Bus_front.xml
    ii> Cars.xml

Similary as we will also detect & count cars in a video 
so we also need to download vide with name "Cars.mp4"
    
   

Google Colab:
-------------
We will be using Google Colab because Google Colab is an online platform that 
provides a Jupyter Notebook environment with free access to GPU and cloud 
computing resources, which can be useful for running computationally intensive 
tasks like image processing.

OpenCV
------------
We will be using OpenCV because OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is an 
popular platform independent open-source library for computer vision and
image processing tasks which provides a vast collection of image processing 
techniques and algorithms, making it easier to perform various tasks such as
image filtering, edge detection, object recognition, image segmentation, and
more that allow developers to manipulate and analyze images and videos.


HAAR CASCADE:
------------- 
Haar cascade which is an algorithm used for object detection which is known 
for its computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications
on resource-constrained devices. And we can also create our own customize 
HAAR CASCADE classifier. 

Haar Cascade can be trained with relatively small training datasets compared 
to deep learning approaches.
  

Required step to complete the Project
======================================

1> Loading the image from the internet:
   ------------------------------------
   First we will load the image from the internet using request library.
    
2> Resizing the image and convert into a numpy array

3> converting image into greyscale
   --------------------------------
   We will the covert the image into greyscale because greyscale image are less
   complex.

4> Load the XML file which contains the HAAR CASCADE
   --------------------------------------------------
   Then we will download & load the XML file which contains the HAAR CASCADE 
   algorithm that can be used for vehicle classification.

5> use HAAR CASCADE to detect the vehicle in the image. 

6> As soon as we detect the vehicle in image then we use the "contours" to 
   create a rectangle around all the detected vehicles(CARS).
    
7> Similary we will perform these operations for another image for 
   Bus Detection

8> For Bus_Detection we will need to download Bus-Detection HAAR CASCADE
   which is an XML file. 

9> We will also perform similar operations on a video also.

10> And the vide will be saved in the end in which object will be detected 
    in particular frames.
